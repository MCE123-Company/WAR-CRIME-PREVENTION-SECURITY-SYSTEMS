## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability, log in to GitHub, and submit an issue or a feature request to us, to be added in a future version.

Click on Issues in This Repository, and we will add the feature to a new version as soon as possible. If the vulnerability is accepted, it will be added to a new version, or
if it was declined, it will be kept in the documentation and described as to why it is not bein included in a future update, such as it already being a feature under a different terminology.
