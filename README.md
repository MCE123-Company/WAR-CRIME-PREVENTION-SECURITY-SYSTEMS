War Crimes Prevention Security Systems is an all-encompassing software suite that comprehensively stops digital war crimes from occurring, which often occur due to illegal national government lawsuits through the use of satellite weapons that target the human body and cause pain or discomfort or injury that is conveinently applied as damages in the illegal lawsuit.

In past dealings with the U.S. Government, MCE123™ has used external International courts to resolve disputes over uses of the U.S. Government's use of satellite weaponry in illegal war crimes lawsuits that conduct war crimes towards civilians from members of the U.S. military. If you are a victim of these types of war crimes, please get in touch with [The International Criminal Court (https://www.icc-cpi.int)](https://www.icc-cpi.int).
